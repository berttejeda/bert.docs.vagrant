## Forward

Thank you for taking interest in this interactive document.

If you're on the Windows platform, you'll likely be accessing this file in its **.HTA** format, 
which provides a superior experience for interaction with your workstation or laptop. 

You can also output the resulting document as a **.html** file, which will allow you to open it in a web browser, but some caveats before you do that:

- If opening the document in a browser other than Internet Explorer, the shell interaction will **not** work at all
- If using Internet Explorer to open the .html file, should you choose to go that route, you'll need to allow ActiveX controls once prompted

Moving on.

## How to Use this Document

Notice the navigation bar at the <a href="#" class="flash" data-selector="#topnav" data-duration="300">top</a>. 

There are several buttons, one of which reads <a href="#" class="menu-toggle">Sidebar</a>

Clicking it will reveal a navigation menu on the left. That's pretty much all you need to know to get around this document.

If you're on Windows and you're running this as .HTA or via Internet Explorer, 
you can utilize the command buttons up top for launching system processes, e.g. <a href="#" class="flash" data-selector="#requirements" data-duration="300">Install Lab Requirements</a>

## What This Lab Covers

Here's what I will cover for Lab 1 of this Vagrant tutorial series:

- How to install Vagrant on Windows/Linux/MacOS
- How to prepare a test environment for using Vagrant

Let's begin with the first topic: <a href="#" id="vagrant_introduction" class="section_link">What is vagrant?</a>
